# APIX English Center Management System — Backend Engineering Standard

> Version: 3.0  
> Language: English  
> Product: APIX English Center Management System  
> Architecture goal: practical ERP for one private English center, with strong auditability, permission safety, and workflows that match real center operations.

---

## 0. Executive Domain Update

This version updates the backend domain to match the real operating logic of the center.

Major corrections from the previous design:

1. Replace student-submitted homework with weekly class updates for parents.
2. Simplify score management: define a score item, enter the numeric score, and optionally add a note.
3. Make payroll flexible for hourly and monthly employees.
4. Connect approved leave requests to payroll deductions.
5. Add fixed schedule pattern support for MWF, TTS, and Weekend classes.
6. Allow Office Staff to pre-mark or mark attendance for a full class.
7. Add attendance deadline reminders: teacher must complete attendance within 30 minutes after class starts.
8. Add Office Staff review workflow for attendance, weekly updates, and learning reports.
9. Make tuition flexible with monthly fees, extra fees such as books, refund policies, and attendance-based credits.
10. Replace fixed skill-based learning reports with flexible two-month narrative reports.
11. Add video/media delivery metadata while storing large video files in object storage.
12. Make audit logging mandatory for all create, update, delete, approval, cancellation, payroll, finance, and delivery actions.
13. Keep backend and frontend synchronized through explicit API contracts and permission codes.

## 1. Non-Negotiable Architecture Rules

### 1.1 Modular monolith first

Use a modular monolith. Do not split into microservices at this stage.

Recommended package shape:

```text
src/main/java/com/apixenglish/center
├── common
├── config
├── security
├── modules
│   ├── auth
│   ├── user
│   ├── role
│   ├── permission
│   ├── employee
│   ├── position
│   ├── parent
│   ├── student
│   ├── campus
│   ├── room
│   ├── course
│   ├── curriculum
│   ├── classmanagement
│   ├── schedule
│   ├── enrollment
│   ├── attendance
│   ├── weeklyupdate

└── jobs
    ├── schedule
    ├── attendance
    ├── tuition

```

Each module must follow:

```text

├── service
│   └── impl
├── repository
├── entity
├── dto
│   ├── request
│   └── response
├── mapper

├── specification
├── event
├── listener
└── exception
```

### 1.2 Database standard

Use PostgreSQL as the source of truth.

Every main business table must include:

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Not null |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Not null |
| `created_by` | UUID | Nullable FK to `users.id` |
| `updated_by` | UUID | Nullable FK to `users.id` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Nullable soft delete marker |
| `version` | INTEGER | Not null optimistic lock |

Never physically delete important business records. Use soft delete and audit logs.

### 1.3 Permission rule

Never do this:

```java
if (role.equals("TEACHER")) { ... }
```

Always do this:

```java
permissionChecker.require(userId, "attendance:mark");
```

Role names can exist as seed data, but business logic must depend on permission codes.

---

## 2. Roles and Responsibility Model

Roles are dynamic records in `roles`, but the first production seed should include these operational role templates.

### 2.1 Super Admin

Purpose: system owner and technical administrator.

Default permission scope:

## 3. Permission Code Matrix

Use these permission codes as the backend/frontend contract.

| Module | Permission examples |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | `dashboard:owner-read`, `dashboard:office-read`, `dashboard:teacher-read`, `dashboard:parent-read`, `dashboard:student-read`, `dashboard:employee-read` |
| Users/RBAC | `user:read`, `user:create`, `user:update`, `role:read`, `role:manage`, `permission:read`, `permission:assign` |
| Employee | `employee:read`, `employee:create`, `employee:update`, `employee:delete`, `employee:salary-read` |
| Student | `student:read`, `student:create`, `student:update`, `student:delete`, `student:academic-note-create` |
| Parent | `parent:read`, `parent:create`, `parent:update`, `parent:delete`, `parent:contact-read` |
| Class | `class:read`, `class:create`, `class:update`, `class:assign-staff`, `class:read-assigned` |
| Schedule | `schedule:read`, `schedule:create`, `schedule:update`, `schedule:generate-session`, `schedule:resolve-conflict` |

---

## 4. Core Data Model to Keep

Keep these foundation modules from the existing standard, with normal audit/common columns:

- `users`, `refresh_tokens`
- `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`, `user_roles`
- `employees`, `positions`, `employee_positions`, `employee_contracts`, `employee_certificates`
- `parents`, `students`, `student_parents`
- `campuses`, `rooms`, `room_facilities`
- `levels`, `courses`, `curriculums`, `lessons`, `vocabulary_items`, `grammar_items`
- `classes`, `class_staff`, `class_enrollments`, `enrollment_transfers`, `enrollment_freezes`

Important student/account rules:

```text
A student profile can exist without a login account.
A parent profile can exist without a login account.
A teacher must normally have an employee profile and login account.
Teachers can view student academic information but must not see parent private contact information by default.
```

---

## 5. Schedule Design for APIX Fixed Class Time Rules

The center has three fixed schedule patterns:

| Pattern | Days | Slots |
|---|---|---|
| `MWF` | Monday, Wednesday, Friday | Slot 1: 18:00-19:30, Slot 2: 19:30-21:00 |
| `TTS` | Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday | Slot 1: 18:00-19:30, Slot 2: 19:30-21:00 |
| `WEEKEND` | Saturday, Sunday | Morning: 09:00-11:00, Afternoon: 15:00-17:00 |

Weekend rule:

```text
If a class uses WEEKEND_MORNING, both Saturday and Sunday must be morning.
If a class uses WEEKEND_AFTERNOON, both Saturday and Sunday must be afternoon.
Do not allow Saturday afternoon + Sunday morning for the same weekend class plan.
```

### 5.1 `schedule_patterns`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `code` | VARCHAR(50) | Unique: MWF, TTS, WEEKEND |
| `name` | VARCHAR(150) | Not null |
| `description` | TEXT | Nullable |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | Default true |
| common columns | | Required |

### 5.2 `schedule_pattern_days`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `schedule_pattern_id` | UUID | FK schedule_patterns.id |
| `day_of_week` | SMALLINT | 1=Monday, 7=Sunday |
| common columns | | Required |

Unique:

```sql
UNIQUE (schedule_pattern_id, day_of_week)
CHECK (day_of_week BETWEEN 1 AND 7)
```

### 5.3 `time_slots`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `code` | VARCHAR(50) | Unique |
| `name` | VARCHAR(150) | Not null |
| `start_time` | TIME | Not null |
| `end_time` | TIME | Not null |
| `slot_group` | VARCHAR(50) | EVENING, WEEKEND_MORNING, WEEKEND_AFTERNOON |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | Default true |
| common columns | | Required |

Constraint:

```sql
CHECK (start_time < end_time)
```

Seed examples:

```text
EVENING_SLOT_1: 18:00-19:30
EVENING_SLOT_2: 19:30-21:00
WEEKEND_MORNING: 09:00-11:00
WEEKEND_AFTERNOON: 15:00-17:00
```

### 5.4 `class_schedule_plans`

Stores the schedule plan selected for a class.

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `class_id` | UUID | FK classes.id |
| `schedule_pattern_id` | UUID | FK schedule_patterns.id |
| `time_slot_id` | UUID | FK time_slots.id |
| `room_id` | UUID | FK rooms.id |
| `effective_from` | DATE | Not null |
| `effective_to` | DATE | Nullable |
| `status` | VARCHAR(30) | ACTIVE, INACTIVE |
| common columns | | Required |

Business rules:

- A class can have one active schedule plan at a time.
- Creating a schedule plan generates `class_schedules` rows based on pattern days.
- Backend must reject teacher, assistant, and room conflicts.
- `class_schedules` remains the normalized weekly schedule table used by session generation.

---

## 6. Class Visibility and Student Handover Notes

### 6.1 Class assignment rule

Teachers see only classes where they are assigned in `class_staff` and the assignment is active.

Backend list APIs must enforce this using permissions:

```text
class:read          -> can read all classes within granted scope
class:read-assigned -> can read assigned classes only
```

Do not rely on frontend filters for this rule.

### 6.2 `student_learning_notes`

Stores teacher notes used for handover when a student transfers or moves to a new class.

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `student_id` | UUID | FK students.id |
| `class_id` | UUID | Nullable FK classes.id |
| `enrollment_id` | UUID | Nullable FK class_enrollments.id |
| `note_type` | VARCHAR(50) | GENERAL, BEHAVIOR, STRENGTH, WEAKNESS, HANDOVER, WARNING |
| `content` | TEXT | Not null |
| `visibility` | VARCHAR(50) | INTERNAL_ACADEMIC, CLASS_STAFF_ONLY |
| `created_by_employee_id` | UUID | FK employees.id |
| common columns | | Required |

Rules:

- Teacher can create notes for assigned students.
- New assigned teacher can view previous academic handover notes.
- Parent and student accounts cannot view internal teacher notes.
- Notes are audit logged.

---

## 7. Attendance Workflow

Attendance must support both teacher and Office Staff workflows.

### 7.1 Business rules

1. Attendance due time = `class_sessions.start_time + 30 minutes`.
2. Teacher receives reminder if attendance is not submitted by due time.
3. Office Staff dashboard must show classes with attendance status:
   - Not started
   - In progress
   - Submitted by teacher
   - Reviewed by office
   - Overdue
4. Office Staff can pre-mark an individual student as absent/excused before the teacher marks attendance.
5. Office Staff can bulk mark an entire class.
6. If Office Staff pre-marks a record and locks it, teacher can see it but cannot edit it unless they have `attendance:override`.
7. Attendance can affect tuition refund/credit only if policy allows and the attendance record is eligible.

### 7.2 `class_session_attendance_status`

Stores session-level attendance progress.

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |

UNIQUE (session_id, student_id)
```

### 7.4 `attendance_follow_ups`

Stores office follow-up status for absent students.

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |

| `reason_summary` | TEXT | Nullable |
| `contact_log_id` | UUID | Nullable FK contact_logs.id |
| common columns | | Required |

---

## 8. Weekly Class Update Workflow

This replaces the old homework submission model.

Students do not need to submit assignments in the system. The teacher writes what the class learned each week and what homework was assigned. Office Staff approves and delivers it to parents through web notifications now and Zalo later.

### 8.1 Tables to remove or deprecate

Deprecated for this center workflow:

```text
homework_assignments
homework_submissions
```

If these tables already exist, do not physically drop them in production without a migration plan. Mark the module deprecated and introduce the new weekly update module.

### 8.2 `weekly_class_updates`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `class_id` | UUID | FK classes.id |
| `week_start_date` | DATE | Monday or configured week start |

| `published_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Nullable |
| common columns | | Required |

Unique active draft/published rule:

```sql
UNIQUE (class_id, week_start_date, week_end_date) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### 8.3 `weekly_update_session_items`

Stores the content for each lesson/session inside the weekly update.

| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `weekly_update_id` | UUID | FK weekly_class_updates.id |
| `session_id` | UUID | Nullable FK class_sessions.id |
| `session_date` | DATE | Not null |
| `lesson_no` | INTEGER | Nullable |
| `learning_content` | TEXT | Not null |
| `homework_content` | TEXT | Nullable |
| `note` | TEXT | Nullable |
| common columns | | Required |

### 8.4 `weekly_update_files`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `weekly_update_id` | UUID | FK weekly_class_updates.id |

| common columns | | Required |

### 8.5 `weekly_update_deliveries`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|

| `read_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Nullable |
| `note` | TEXT | Nullable |
| common columns | | Required |

---

## 9. Simple Score Management

The score module should be intentionally simple.

The teacher or staff defines what the score is, enters the numeric score, and optionally writes a note.

### 9.1 Tables to remove or simplify

Deprecated for this center workflow:

```text
score_components
assessments
student_scores as complex assessment model
```

Use the following simpler model.

### 9.2 `score_items`

Defines a score entry for a class.

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `class_id` | UUID | FK classes.id |

| `graded_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Not null |
| common columns | | Required |

Unique:

```sql
UNIQUE (score_item_id, student_id)
```

Rules:

- `score_value` must be between 0 and `max_score` when `max_score` is set.
- Parent and student can see only published scores.
- Teacher can edit draft scores for assigned classes.
- Locked scores require `score:update-locked` if this permission is added later.

---

## 10. Two-Month Learning Report Workflow

Learning reports should be flexible narrative reports, not fixed skill-by-skill forms.

### 10.1 `learning_report_cycles`

## 12. Payroll and Leave Management

The center has two main payroll modes:

1. Hourly salary.
2. Monthly salary.

### 12.1 Payroll business rules

Hourly employee:

```text
Salary = approved work hours × hourly rate + approved allowances - deductions
If the employee does not work on a day, no salary is generated for that day.
Most hourly employees have no allowance, but the system must support allowance lines.
```

Monthly employee:

```text
Monthly gross = monthly base salary + approved allowances
Daily rate = monthly gross / standard work days
Default standard work days = 26
Leave deduction = approved deductible leave days × daily rate
Net salary = monthly gross - leave deduction + other additions - other deductions
```

Leave rule:

```text
Approved leave requests automatically generate payroll deduction lines when the salary profile says the leave is deductible.
If the leave date has not arrived, employee can request cancellation.
Cancellation requires manager approval.
```

### 12.2 `salary_profiles`

| Column | Type | Rule |

## 13. Media and Video Delivery

Video can be integrated into the system, but the application must not store heavy files in PostgreSQL or on the app server.

Recommended decision:

```text
Store video files in Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or MinIO.
Store only metadata, ownership, delivery status, and access links in PostgreSQL.
```

This is better than sending videos directly through a staff member's Zalo because it keeps history, ownership, delivery status, and parent/student access in one system.

Zalo can be used later as a notification channel that links to the web media item instead of sending heavy files directly.

### 13.1 `media_items`

| Column | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | PK |
| `media_type` | VARCHAR(30) | IMAGE, VIDEO, DOCUMENT |

| `uploaded_by` | UUID | FK employees.id |
| `status` | VARCHAR(30) | DRAFT, READY, PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED |
| common columns | | Required |

Rules:

- `MONTHLY_PERSONAL` video should usually have `student_id`.
- `FOREIGN_TEACHER_ACTIVITY` can be class-level.
- `FINAL_COURSE` can be class-level or student-level.

### 13.2 `media_deliveries`

## 19. AI Feature Suggestions

AI should assist staff, not replace approvals.

Useful AI features:

1. Draft weekly class update from lesson/session notes.
2. Draft two-month learning report from attendance, scores, and teacher notes.
3. Suggest student progress risks from repeated absences, low scores, and teacher notes.
4. Generate parent-friendly message drafts for Office Staff.
5. Generate class activity ideas for teachers.
6. Generate speaking questions and homework suggestions by course level.
7. Summarize audit/activity history when investigating mistakes.

AI outputs must be drafts and require human review before sending to parents.

## 21. Definition of Done

A backend feature is done only when:

- Database migration exists.
- Entity, repository, service, controller, DTO, mapper are implemented where needed.
- Permission check is enforced in service/controller.
- Frontend-required response DTOs are flat and stable.
- Write operations are transactional.
- Audit log is created for important changes.
- List APIs have server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- Validation handles business rules and bad states.
- Tests cover main service logic and security denial.
- API docs are updated.
- No business logic depends on hardcoded role names.
- Backend routes match the frontend route/API contract in this file.
